Decentralized Voting System

Overview
The Decentralized Voting System is a secure and transparent platform built on Ethereum blockchain technology, designed to facilitate fair and tamper-proof elections. Utilizing JavaScript, React, and the Ethereum blockchain with MetaMask integration, this system ensures that each vote is securely recorded and immutable. Additionally, Firebase authentication is incorporated to provide a seamless and secure login process for users.

Features
Transparent and Immutable Elections: Utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to store all voting data, ensuring transparency and immutability of election results.
MetaMask Integration: Users can securely interact with the Ethereum blockchain through MetaMask, enabling seamless voting and transaction processing.
Dual User Roles: The system supports two types of users: voters and admins. Admins have the authority to schedule elections and add new voters, while voters can participate in elections by casting their votes.
Secure Authentication: Firebase authentication is implemented to verify the identity of users and ensure secure access to the platform.
Decentralized Governance: Empowers users to participate in a decentralized governance model by enabling them to vote in elections without the need for intermediaries or centralized authorities.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Mr-Yash-01/VotingSystem.git
Set up Firebase project:

Create a Firebase project on the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com).
Enable Authentication service and configure authentication methods (e.g., email/password).
Obtain Firebase configuration settings (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.).
Configure MetaMask:

Install MetaMask browser extension (https://metamask.io/) and set up an Ethereum wallet.
Connect MetaMask to the desired Ethereum network (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby, Mainnet).
Update Firebase configuration:

Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration settings in the project's source code with your own Firebase project settings.
Build and run the project using your preferred development environment or command-line tools.

Usage
Sign up for an account using Firebase authentication (email/password, Google Sign-In).

As an admin:

Schedule elections by specifying the election details, such as title, start/end dates, and eligible voters.
Add new voters by providing their details and verifying their eligibility.
As a voter:

Access the list of available elections and view their details.
Cast votes for the desired candidate in each election.
Monitor election results:

View real-time updates on the status of ongoing elections and the final results.
Verify the integrity of election results through the transparent and immutable blockchain records.
